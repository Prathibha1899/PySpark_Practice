# 🔥 PySpark Solutions for LeetCode SQL 50

Welcome to my PySpark-powered take on the LeetCode SQL 50 challenge!  
This repository contains **PySpark equivalents** of the popular SQL problems, designed to help data engineers and aspiring data professionals apply SQL logic in a distributed computing environment.

## 💡 Why PySpark?

While SQL is essential, many real-world data pipelines rely on tools like **PySpark** for scalability and performance. This project aims to bridge that gap by:

- Translating each SQL problem into **PySpark DataFrame API**
- Reinforcing concepts like **filtering, joins, window functions, grouping, aggregation**
- Showcasing how SQL logic is implemented in a **Python-based distributed setting**

## 🗂️ Structure

Each problem includes:

- ✅ Problem description (brief)
- ✅ PySpark solution using `DataFrame` API
- ✅ Optional inline comments for clarity
- ✅ `.show()` outputs to verify results
